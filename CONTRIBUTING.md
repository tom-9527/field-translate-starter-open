# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This repository uses a review-first workflow: all changes must go through Pull Requests and be approved by the maintainer.

## Quick Start
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes.
3. Run local build checks if applicable.
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) to `main`.

## Branch & PR Rules
- Direct pushes to `main` are blocked for contributors.
- PRs require at least 1 approval.
- Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
- Describe **what changed** and **why**.

## Code Style
- Keep formatting consistent with existing code.
- Prefer clear naming and minimal magic.
- Add comments only where non-obvious logic needs context.

## Tests
- If you add behavior, add or update tests when feasible.
- If tests are not available, describe manual verification steps in the PR.

## Commit Messages
Use concise, descriptive messages. Examples:
- `fix: handle static fields in reflection`
- `docs: add usage manual`

## Reporting Issues
When reporting a bug, include:
- Steps to reproduce
